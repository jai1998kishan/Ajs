// It's the ability of one method to return different values according to certain conditions.

// But we can see that when we call the method on different species, we get different results:

//parameter-based polymorphism.
// const alien2 = new Alien("Lien", "Run for your lives!", 15, 60)
// const bug1 = new Bug("Buggy", "Your debugger doesn't work with me!", 25, 100)

// alien2.sayPhrase() // output: "Run for your lives!"
// bug1.sayPhrase() // output: "Your debugger doesn't work with me!"

//And that's because we passed each class a different parameter at instantiation. That's one kind of polymorphism, parameter-based. ðŸ‘Œ

//-----------------------------------------------

//Another kind of polymorphism is inheritance-based, and that refers to when we have a parent class that sets a method and the child overrides that method to modify it in some way. The example we saw previously applies perfectly here as well:

class Character {
  constructor(speed) {
    this.speed = speed;
  }
  move = () => console.log(`I'm moving at the speed of ${this.speed}`);
}
class Enemy extends Character {
  constructor(name, phrase, power, speed) {
    super(speed);
    this.name = name;
    this.phrase = phrase;
    this.power = power;
  }
  sayPhrase = () => console.log(this.phrase);
  attack = () => console.log(`I'm attacking with a power of ${this.power}!`);
}

class Alien extends Enemy {
  constructor(name, phrase, power, speed) {
    super(name, phrase, power, speed);
    this.species = "alien";
  }
  fly = () => console.log("Zzzzzziiiiiinnnnnggggg!!");
  attack = () => console.log("Now I'm doing a different thing, HA!"); // Override the parent method.
}

const alien1 = new Alien("Ali", "I'm Ali the alien!", 10, 50);
alien1.attack(); // output: "Now I'm doing a different thing, HA!"
