/*
Abstraction is a principle that says that a class should only represent information that is relevant to the problem's context. In plain English, only expose to the outside the properties and methods that you're going to use. If it's not needed, don't expose it.

This principle is closely related to encapsulation, as we can use public and private properties/methods to decide what gets exposed and what doesn't.
